# JavaScript Runtime

-   It is an environment which provides all the necessary components to run a javascript program.
-   JavaScript engine is one component of the JavaScript runtime.

## What else JavaScript runtime consists of?

1. JavaScript Engine -> Call Stack (where the code is executed), Heap Memory (where the memory allocation happens)
2. Web/Browser APIs(DOM, Storage, Timers(SetTimeout, SetIntervals)) -> MicroTask Queue, Callback/Task Queue, Event Loop

-   Queues are used to store the tasks that are to be executed in the future (Async task waits here).
-   Event Loop is a mechanism that makes sure that the code is executed in the correct order(Async tasks are performed in right order).

This is the JavaScript runtime environment in the browser.
