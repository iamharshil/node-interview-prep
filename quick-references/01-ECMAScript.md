## What is ECMAScript

-   In 1993, the first web browser with user interface called mosaic was released.
-   In 1994, the lead developer of Mosaic founded a company called netscape and released a more polished browser called netscape navigator.
-   Web pages were static and there was no interactivity after page was loaded.
-   In 1995, Netscape created a new scripting language called JavaScript.
-   In 1995 Microsoft debuted their internet explorer.
-   Microsoft realized that JvaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for internet explorer, but there was no specifications to follow.

in 1996 Microsoft reverse engineered Navigator interpreter to create its own scripting language called JScript.
It made difficulties for web developers to write code that worked in both browsers because of different implementations of JavaScript.
in Nov 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization.
NetScape wanted to standardize JavaScript so that it could be used in other browsers.
ECMA International is a standards organization for information and communication systems.
ECMA International created a technical committee called TC39 to standardize JavaScript.
In June 1997, ECMA International published the first edition of ECMAScript standard.
ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages.
JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript standard.
JavaScript is a trademark of Oracle Corporation So we user Javascript build on top of ECMAScript standard.
