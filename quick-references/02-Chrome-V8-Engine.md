# Chrome V8 Engine

JavaScript code we write cannot be understood by the computer, for that we need javascript engine. A JavaScript engine is a program that converts javascript code that developers write into machine code that allow computer to perform specific tasks.

There are many JavaScript engine use by different browsers here are some of them:

-   V8: Open source JavaScript engine developed by google for Chrome
-   SpiderMonkey: By Mozilla Firefox
-   JavaScriptCore: Open source JavaScript engine developed by Apple for Safari
-   Chakra: Developed by Microsoft for Edge

V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source version of V8 is called Node.js. By writing C++ code we can implement new feature into JavaScript engine itself.

Since C++ is low level language and has access to file handling, database connections and network operations, by embedding V8 into your own C++ program, you have the power to add all of that functionality into JavaScript. Here C++ Program is Node.js.
